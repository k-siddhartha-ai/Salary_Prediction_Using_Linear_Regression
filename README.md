💼 Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

An interactive Machine Learning web application that predicts salary (in thousands) based on skill level using an explainable Linear Regression model.

Designed as a lightweight end-to-end ML project demonstrating model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment using Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.

🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases a simple yet interpretable regression workflow:

Synthetic dataset for controlled experimentation

Linear Regression for salary prediction

Interactive user input using Streamlit

Real-time inference and visualization

Model performance metrics (MSE, R²)

The goal is to demonstrate core regression concepts, clean UI design, and reproducible ML deployment.

🛠 Tech Stack

⚙️ How It Works

Synthetic skill vs salary data is generated

Linear Regression model is trained

User selects skill level through UI

Model predicts salary instantly

Visualization displays regression behavior

🌐 Deployment

Built using Streamlit

Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
